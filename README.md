# news_categorization
This News Category Prediction Web App is a machine learning-based application that classifies news snippets into four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. It features a Python Flask backend with a trained model using TF-IDF and scikit-learn, and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for user interaction. Users can input any news content to get real-time predictions, view the last five predictions with timestamps, and switch between light and dark themes using an intuitive toggle. The app combines natural language processing with a clean UI to demonstrate practical text classification in a modern web environment.
